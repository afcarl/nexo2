In S. cerevisiae, the complex consists of either Pap2 (also known as Trf4) or Trf5, Air1 or Air2, and Mtr4, and is involved in RNA 3'-end processing and in RNA surveillance and quality control. | BP_def: The enzymatic addition of a sequence of adenylyl residues at the 3' end of a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecule. In eukaryotes, substrates include nuclear non-coding RNAs such as precursors and a variety of incorrectly processed forms of snRNAs, snoRNAs, rRNAs, and tRNAs, as well as discarded RNA fragments which have been removed from ncRNA primary transcripts. Polyadenylation of precursors is often linked to termination of transcription, but polyadenylation of RNAs targeted for degradation may also occur post-transcriptionally. This polyadenylation is important both for 3'-end processing to produce mature ncRNA species and also for targeting incorrectly processed or discarded RNA molecules for degradation. | MF_def:Catalysis of the template-independent extension of the 3'- end of an RNA or DNA strand by addition of one adenosine molecule at a time. Cannot initiate a chain 'de novo'.

This binds both to the N-terminal signal peptide for proteins destined for the endoplasmic reticulum as they emerge from the large ribosomal subunit and also to the ribosome. This binding arrests further translation thereby preventing the proteins from being released into the cytosol. The SRP-ribosome complex then diffuses to the endoplasmic reticulum where it is bound to the signal recognition particle receptor, which allows resumption of protein synthesis and facilitates the passage of the growing polypeptide chain through the translocon. Through a process involving GTP hydrolysis, the SRP-SRP receptor complex dissociates and SRP returns to the cytosol. Of the six polypeptides of SRP the 54 kDa subunit (SRP54) is the central player. It contains an N-terminal GTPase domain and a C-terminal domain that binds directly to the signal peptide and the SRP RNA.

In yeast, this complex consists of two subcomplexes, namely, the Sec61 complex and the Sec62/Sec63 complex. | BP_def: The process in which a protein translocates through the ER membrane posttranslationally. | MF_def:Primary active carrier-mediated transport of a protein across a membrane, driven by the hydrolysis of the diphosphate bond of inorganic pyrophosphate, ATP, or another nucleoside triphosphate. The transport protein may or may not be transiently phosphorylated, but the substrate is not phosphorylated.	robustness:4.49421882480414 density:0.8 bootstrap:0.454105753 cc_score:0.565649 bp_score:0.432695 mf_score:0.197895

The reaction involves the formation of a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate. Release of the enzyme and free base by a beta-elimination or a beta, gamma-elimination mechanism results in the cleavage of the DNA backbone 3' of the apurinic (AP) site.	robustness:3.87768197513066 density:1 bootstrap:0.830505581 cc_score:0.0 bp_score:0.0 mf_score:0.250895
