The complex comprises a membrane sector (F0, V0, or A0) that carries out proton transport and a cytoplasmic compartment sector (F1, V1, or A1) that catalyzes ATP synthesis or hydrolysis. Two major types have been characterized: V-type ATPases couple ATP hydrolysis to the transport of protons across a concentration gradient, whereas F-type ATPases, also known as ATP synthases, normally run in the reverse direction to utilize energy from a proton concentration or electrochemical gradient to synthesize ATP. A third type, A-type ATPases have been found in archaea, and are closely related to eukaryotic V-type ATPases but are reversible. | BP_def: Any process that modulates the internal pH of a cell, measured by the concentration of the hydrogen ion. | MF_def:Catalysis of the transfer of an ion from one side of a membrane to the other, driven by the reaction: ATP + H2O = ADP + phosphate."
